\# ðŸš€ Day 23 â€“ DSA Challenge



This day focuses on some basic problem of math like "Palindrome number" and "Power of Three"



...



ðŸ“Œ 326. Power of Three

Problem Statement

Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.



An integer n is a power of three if there exists an integer x such that:



n == 3^x

Example:

Input: n = 27

Output: true

Explanation: 3^3 = 27





Constraints:

-2^31 <= n <= 2^31 - 1



Approach

Loop Division Method



Keep dividing n by 3 as long as itâ€™s divisible.



If we end up with n == 1, itâ€™s a power of three.



Logarithmic Method



Use logarithms to check if log3(n) is an integer.



Max Power Method



Use the fact that the maximum power of 3 in 32-bit signed integer is 3^19 = 1162261467.



If n > 0 and 1162261467 % n == 0, itâ€™s a power of three.



Java Solution (Loop Division)

...java



class PowerofThree {

&nbsp;   public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {

&nbsp;       if(n==1) return true;

&nbsp;       if(n<1 || n%3!=0) return false;

&nbsp;       return isPowerOfThree(n/3);

&nbsp;   }

}



ðŸ“Œ 9. Palindrome Number

Problem Statement

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.



An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same forward and backward.

Example:

Input: x = 121

Output: true

Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.



Constraints:

-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1



Approach

String Conversion



Convert the integer to a string and check if itâ€™s the same reversed.



Mathematical Reverse



Reverse half of the number without converting to string for better performance.



If reversed half equals the remaining half, itâ€™s a palindrome.



Java Solution (Mathematical Approach)



...java



class Solution {

&nbsp;   public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {

&nbsp;       if(x<0) return false;



&nbsp;       int temp = x;

&nbsp;       int reverse = 0;

&nbsp;       while(x!=0){

&nbsp;           int r = x%10;

&nbsp;           reverse = reverse \* 10 + r;

&nbsp;           x/=10;

&nbsp;       }

&nbsp;       return reverse==temp?true:false;

&nbsp;   }

}

I will continue the same new quest according to the array as well as the string
