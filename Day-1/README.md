\# 🚀 Day 1 – DSA Challenge



Today I started my \*\*100 Days of DSA\*\* journey and solved two important array problems related to searching and partitioning.



---



\## ✅ Problems Solved



\### 1. 🔢 Two Sum (`TwoSum.java`)

\- \*\*Problem\*\*: Given an array of integers and a target, return indices of two numbers that add up to the target.

\- \*\*Approach\*\*: Used a `HashMap` to store values and indices for O(n) lookup.

\- \*\*Time Complexity\*\*: O(n)



\### 2. 📈 Median of Two Sorted Arrays (`findMedianSortedArrays.java`)

\- \*\*Problem\*\*: Find the median of two sorted arrays.

\- \*\*Approach\*\*: Implemented binary search-based solution as per LeetCode’s hard-level approach.

\- \*\*Time Complexity\*\*: O(log(min(n, m)))

\## 🧠 What I Learned

\- Efficient usage of HashMap for constant-time lookup.

\- Binary search in partitioning two sorted arrays.

\- Importance of edge-case handling for even/odd number of elements.
